What drives the price of a car? 

  1.	Year of the Vehicle: Newer vehicles typically sell for higher prices in the used car market due to updated features, technology, and potentially lower mileage.
	2.	Condition of the Vehicle: Cars in excellent or good condition usually command higher prices than those in fair or poor condition.
	3.	Type of Vehicle: Sedans are popular and often have higher price tags, followed by pickups and wagons.
	4.	Odometer: Lower mileage generally results in a higher price, with value decreasing as mileage increases.
	5.	Drive Type: Rear-wheel drive cars tend to be valued higher than front-wheel drive cars.
	6.	Cylinders: Vehicles with larger engines, particularly 8 or 6 cylinders, are preferred and can fetch higher prices.
	7.	Fuel Type: Diesel cars generally sell for more than gas cars, though gas cars remain popular.
	8.	Car Title: A clean title is crucial for maximizing a used carâ€™s value.
	9.	Manufacturer: Toyota and Honda are popular in the used car market, while luxury cars might not sell as easily.

When buying a used car, look for a newer model in excellent condition, with low mileage, rear-wheel drive, a larger engine (8 or 6 cylinders), and a clean title. Models from Toyota and Honda are likely in high demand. When selling, emphasizing these features can help you achieve the highest possible price.
